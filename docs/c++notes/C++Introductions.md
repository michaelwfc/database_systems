# C++ Design Philosophy

[C++ Design Philosophy](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-philosophy)

In 1983, the beginnings of C++ were created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup

- Do not waste time or space(high performance)
- Allow the programmer full control, responsibility, and choice.
- Express ideas and intent directly in code.
- Enforce safety at compile time whenever possible.
- Compartmentalize messy constructs.

C++ is a compiled language


# Most Important Ideas in Modern C++

Modern C++ (roughly C++11 → C++23) is not just “old C++ with extra syntax.”
It represents a major philosophical shift:

> From manual low-level programming → toward safer, expressive, zero-cost abstractions.

## Modern C++ Features
Below is a practical systems-programming-oriented overview.

## The Biggest Philosophical Shifts

### 1. From Manual Memory → Ownership Semantics

Old C++:

```cpp
Foo* p = new Foo();
delete p;
```

Modern C++:

```cpp
auto p = std::make_unique<Foo>();
```

Big shift:

```text
Ownership becomes explicit and automatic.
```

---

### 2. From Copying → Moving

Old C++:

```text
Performance often required pointer tricks.
```

Modern C++:

```cpp
std::move(x)
```

Big shift:

```text
Efficient transfer of resources without copying.
```

---

### 3. From Raw Loops → Generic Algorithms

Old C++:

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
```

Modern C++:

```cpp
std::ranges::sort(vec);
```

Big shift:

```text
Describe WHAT, not HOW.
```

---

### 4. From Unsafe APIs → Type-Safe APIs

Old C++:

```cpp
NULL
char*
int enum
```

Modern C++:

```cpp
nullptr
string_view
enum class
optional<T>
```

Big shift:

```text
More bugs caught at compile time.
```

---

### 5. From Runtime Polymorphism → Compile-Time Polymorphism

Old style:

```cpp
virtual function
```

Modern style:

```cpp
templates + concepts
```

Big shift:

```text
High abstraction without runtime cost.
```

# C++ Baiscs
## C++ is a statically typed language

Why static typing?

- Better performance
- Easier to understand and reason about
- Better error checking

## C++ files

|        | Header File (.h) | Source File (.cpp)|
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------|
| Purpose | Defines the interface Implements class functions |
| Contains | Function prototypes, class  declarations, type definitions,  macros,constants | Function implementations, executable code|
| Access  | This is shared across source files | Is compiled into an object file|
| Example  | void someFunction();  |void someFunction(){...};|

## Types

A type refers to the “category” of a variable

C++ comes with built-in types:
- char: 8-bit character
- int: 32-bit signed integer
- double: 64-bit floating point number
- string: a sequence of characters
- bool: true or false
- size_t: unsigned integer type used for sizes

### Type Safety

The extent to which a function signature guarantees the behavior of a function.



### Quality of life features to improve your code

- using creates type aliases
- auto infers the type of a variable

## std : The C++ Standard Library

- [the official standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

#include from the C++ Standard Library to use built-in types
And use the std:: prefix too!


Built-in types, functions, and more provided by C++
You need to #include the relevant file
- #include <string> → std::string
- #include <utility> → std::pair
- #include <iostream> → std::cout, std::endl
  
We prefix standard library names with std::
If we write using namespace std; we don’t have to, but this is considered bad style as it can introduce ambiguity
(What would happen if we defined our own string?)

### std::optional

std::optional is a template class which will either contain a value of type T or contain nothing (expressed as nullopt)

nullptr: an object that can be converted to a value of any pointer type
nullopt: an object that can be converted to a value of any optional type



## OOP

### Types of inheritance

| Type  | public  | protected | private |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
|Example | class B： public A{...} | class B: protected A{...} |  class B: private A{...} | 
|Public Members | Are public in the derived class | Protected in the derived class | Privated in the derived class |
|Protected Members | Protected in the derived class | Protected in the derived class | Privated in the derived class |
|Private Members |  Not accessible in derived class |Not accessible in derived class | Not accessible in derived class |


### Special Member Functions

6 special member functions

- Default constructor: T() : Object created with no parameters, no member variables instantiated
- Destructor: ~T() ：Object destroyed when it is out of scope.
- Copy constructor: T(const T&) ： Object created as a copy of existing object (member variable-wise)
- Copy assignment operator: T& operator=(const T&) ：  Existing object replaced as a copy of another existing object
- Move constructor: T(T&&)
- Move assignment operator: T& operator=(T&&)

SMFs are automatically generated for you，
-  But if you’re managing pointers to allocated to memory, do it yourself


### Aside: Function Overloading

Defining two functions with the same name but different parameters
