# VM Setup
## the CS144 VM setup

For build prereqs, see [the CS144 VM setup instructions](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs144/vm_howto).

# Sponge quickstart


The CS144 lab is designed to work with the GNU/Linux operating system. You have four options for setting up your development machine:

1. On Intel/AMD computers: Use a VM image that we prepared in VirtualBox
2. Use a Google Cloud virtual machine (we have $50 coupon codes available for the class)
3. Use your own GNU/Linux installation "at your own risk" with a C++23 compiler (GCC 14.2 or later, clang++ 20 or later)
4. On ARM MacBooks and Macs: please install the UTM virtual machine software and use our ARM64 GNU/Linux virtual machine image
Because the labs were designed to use Linux-specific interfaces, we cannot support development on any other operating system—though you’re free to do whatever works for you, so long as the code you turn in works in the supported environment! It's unlikely that MacOS or Microsoft Windows (even with WSL) will be sufficient.

# C++
## cmake: Sponge quickstart
To set up your build directory:
```bash
$ mkdir -p <path/to/sponge>/build
$ cd <path/to/sponge>/build
$ cmake ..
```

CMake generates native build files (Makefiles on Linux, Xcode projects on macOS, Visual Studio solutions on Windows). You write CMakeLists.txt once, and it works across OSs.


### 1. What does `cmake ..` do?
The command `cmake ..` performs the following:
- **Configures the build system**: It reads the `CMakeLists.txt` file from the parent directory (..) to understand project dependencies, compiler flags, and source files.
- **Generates build files**: Creates `Makefiles` or other build system files needed to compile the project
    - Makefiles
    - other build system files: Could be Ninja files, CMake files, MSBuild files, etc.
  
- **Sets up compilation parameters**: Determines compiler settings, dependencies, and build targets
- **Prepares for compilation**: Sets up the environment so you can later run `make` to actually compile the code
The .. indicates that the CMake configuration file (`CMakeLists.txt`) is located one directory level up from where you're running the command (in the build directory). This is part of the standard out-of-source build pattern where build artifacts are kept separate from source code.


### 2. Explanation of the CMakeLists.txt file ?

The [CMakeLists.txt](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/CMakeLists.txt) file in the Sponge networking library defines the build configuration and structure for the entire project:

#### a. Basic Project Configuration
- **`cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8.5)`** - Sets the minimum required CMake version
- **`cmake_policy (SET CMP0054 NEW)`** - Sets a specific CMake policy regarding string comparisons
- **`project (Sponge)`** - Defines the project name as "Sponge"


#### b. Global Configuration (The etc/ includes):

Instead of writing all compiler flags and tool settings here, the project imports them from separate files in the etc/ directory.

The project includes multiple external CMake files that provide additional functionality:
- **[etc/build_defs.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/build_defs.cmake)** - Contains basic build definitions and macros
- **[etc/build_type.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/build_type.cmake)** - Handles build type configurations (Debug, Release, etc.)
- **[etc/cflags.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/cflags.cmake)** - Sets compiler flags (e.g., -std=c++17, warnings).
- **[etc/doxygen.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/doxygen.cmake)** - Configures Doxygen documentation generation
- **[etc/clang_format.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/clang_format.cmake)** - Sets up clang-format for code formatting
- **[etc/clang_tidy.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/clang_tidy.cmake)** - Configures code quality tools clang-tidy for static analysis

- **[etc/cppcheck.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/cppcheck.cmake)** - Integrates cppcheck for static analysis
- **[etc/tests.cmake](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/etc/tests.cmake)** - Defines test-related build targets


#### c. Header Search Paths
`include_directories (...)`: Tells the compiler where to look for .hh (header) files.

The following lines add directories to the header search path:
- **`${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/libsponge/util`** - Utility classes and functions
- **`${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/libsponge/tcp_helpers`** - TCP helper implementations
- **`${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/libsponge`** - Main library headers

It adds libsponge/util, libsponge/tcp_helpers, and libsponge so that any source file in the project can #include "address.hh" or #include "tcp_socket.hh" without specifying the full path.


#### d. Subdirectories

This is the core structural element. It tells CMake to go into these folders and look for their CMakeLists.txt files.


The project organizes its components into subdirectories:
- **[libsponge](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/libsponge/)** - Core networking library implementation
- **[apps](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/apps/)** - Applications built using the library
- **[tests](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/tests/)** - Unit tests and integration tests
- **[doctests](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/doctests/)** - Documentation tests

This structure allows for modular development and separates the library code from applications, tests, and documentation while maintaining proper dependencies between them.

#### e. Test Integration:

include (etc/tests.cmake): Registers the built tests with CTest (CMake's testing driver), allowing you to run make check_lab0.


### 3. What are `Makefiles` or other build system files?
Based on the context from the Sponge networking library README, here's an explanation:

**Makefiles** and **other build system files** are configuration files that contain instructions for building software projects:

#### Makefiles
- **Text files** containing rules and dependencies that tell the `make` utility how to compile and link source code
- Define **targets**, **dependencies**, and **commands** needed to build executables from source code
- Specify which source files need to be compiled together and in what order
- Include information about compiler flags, libraries, and linking requirements

#### Other Build System Files
- Could be **Ninja files**, **CMake files**, **MSBuild files**, etc.
- In the context of the Sponge project, these would be generated by `cmake ..` from the [CMakeLists.txt](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/CMakeLists.txt) file
- Provide alternative ways to manage the build process beyond traditional Makefiles

#### Purpose
- **Automate compilation**: Save developers from manually typing compilation commands for each source file
- **Handle dependencies**: Track which files depend on others and rebuild only what's necessary
- **Optimize builds**: Only recompile files that have changed since the last build
- **Manage complexity**: Handle complex software projects with hundreds or thousands of source files

As mentioned in the README, the `cmake ..` command generates these files in the build directory based on the configuration found in the parent directory's [CMakeLists.txt](file:///home/cs144/computer_network/sponge/CMakeLists.txt) file.




**Note:** all further commands listed below should be run from the `build` dir.

## B. `make`: To build

```bash
# This command compiles and links the source code into executable programs and libraries.
$ make


# You can use the `-j` switch to build in parallel, e.g.,
$ make -j$(nproc)

```

The first time you run a `make check`, it may run `sudo` to configure two
[TUN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt) devices for use during testing.

### 1. build options

You can specify a different compiler when you run cmake:
```bash
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..
```
You can also specify `CLANG_TIDY=` or `CLANG_FORMAT=` (see "other useful targets", below).

Sponge's build system supports several different build targets. 
- By default, cmake chooses the `Release` target, which enables the usual optimizations. 
- The `Debug` target enables debugging and reduces the level of optimization. To choose the `Debug` target:

```bash
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
The following targets are supported:

- `Release` - optimizations
- `Debug` - debug symbols and `-Og`
- `RelASan` - release build with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and
  [UBSan](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan/)
- `RelTSan` - release build with
  [ThreadSan](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Thread_Sanitizer)
- `DebugASan` - debug build with ASan and UBSan
- `DebugTSan` - debug build with ThreadSan

Of course, you can combine all of the above, e.g.,

    $ CLANG_TIDY=clang-tidy-6.0 CXX=clang++-6.0 .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

**Note:** if you want to change `CC`, `CXX`, `CLANG_TIDY`, or `CLANG_FORMAT`, you need to remove
`build/CMakeCache.txt` and re-run cmake. (This isn't necessary for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.)


## C. To test
To test (after building; make sure you've got the [build prereqs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs144/vm_howto) installed!)

```bash
$ make check_lab0
# or
$ make check_lab1
```

The first time you run a `make check`, it may run `sudo` to configure two
[TUN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt) devices for use during testing.
